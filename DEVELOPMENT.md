## Checkout your fork

To make local changes to artifact-registry-npm-tools and eventually submit a pull request to the repo,
we recommend [creating your own fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

Once you've done this, clone your fork to your local machine:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:${YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME}/artifact-registry-npm-tools.git
cd artifact-registry-npm-tools
git remote set-url --push upstream no_push
```
